# Private Payroll

## Problem

In todays world, most if not all on-chain payments are publicly visible and let's be honest, who the heck wants everyone to know all your bank transfer details, the invoices you pay and how much salary you earn?

Similarly, the same applies to businesses. One of the main hurdles of using blockchains for payroll is that amounts and recipients are transparent. On top of all of that, running a business is already complex enough but accounting and tax laws make it even harder. So, the problem is:

Most on-chain payments are fully transparent by default. Anyone can see:

- Salaries and contractor payments
- Company revenue and cash flow
- Business relationships and payment patterns

This makes blockchains unsuable (or very annoying) for:

- Payroll
- Invoices
- Subscriptions
- B2B payments
- ..

For real businesses, this is not a nice to have - it's an actual blocker. But at the same time businesses need to inherit to tax laws and auditability from various parties. Businesses need:

- Auditability (accounting, tax, compliance, ..)
- Verifiable receipts
- Selective disclosure (share only what is really required, with whom it’s required)

Currently, the only sultion are to either use public blockchains or private but unverifiable web3 banking solutions.

The goal of this submission is to: `Pay privately, but prove facts about the payment when needed.`
